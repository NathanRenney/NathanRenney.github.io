This site has been built using and influenced by some great tech...

I really like static site generators and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is absolutely my favourite at the moment. Minimal but really great, it perfectly suits me. Built in Rust ðŸ¤˜

The glitch effect was based on Piotr Galor's code pen below. Super cool, css only effect.

I also used a css only dark mode that I found by Philipp @kleinfreund.

This also notes that Mu-An Chiouâ€™s website was the original inspiration, though this doesn't appear to be on the site anymore.

The template here is also inspired and somewhat based on the [Sam](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam) theme, which I used to use for my [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based static site.
