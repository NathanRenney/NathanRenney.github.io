# 'Live Coding' of Music

Many of the languages developed for the creation of music focus, unsurprisingly I guess, on the creation of music. 

We can look at the likes of ChucK, Tidal, Sonic Pi as examples of this. They are all great at what they do and explore interesting concepts, as well as running into some of the challenges of expressing Music in a programming language. 

Without diving to deeply into these languages right now, throughout the DMI literature there are many seemingly advocating for the use of these languages in the performances - perhaps on a similar level/ within the context of DMI. Personally, whilst these may be possible to categorize under the label of DMI, I think the value is else where. They are great educational tools, and amazing art tools.

Honestly, who cant love the idea of trying to express and really nice and complex musical idea inside a small or elegant algorithm. Just like the demo scene is for video demos, these languages can spawn a really interesting way of creating music. 

As a live performance tool though - I really am not sure it meets the bar for a good instrument. 

Also need to check out Orca.
