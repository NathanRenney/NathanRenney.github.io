# Tenet 

> I can't say I'm likely to do lots of film reviews, but I guess when I find something of interest to write about ... I will.

Based on the first watch of Tenet, I have some observations based on the critisim that is leveled toward it. Caveats; I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's films, I'm willing to suspend belief for films sake, I went into the film with no concpetions about what it was about having not followed film releases closely for some time.

To get to the point of what I think about Tenet - I really see it as a kind of thought experiment. I can't see it being targeted at the average block buster fan beyond as a meme for being hard to wrap your head around. In a sense, it is a film for the sake of trying to take high concept ideas and translate them into narratives that explore the idea. Really, it's quite self indulgent and I think it's fresh that Nolan has been able to get the support to make such excellent but alternative cinema. 

If I had to hazard a guess, I would say that the film was inspired by Richard Mullers book 'Now', not least because it left similar plots running through my head after reading it. Wether that is the case or not doesn't make much difference, but it does demonstrate perhaps why these thought experiments (somewhat a staple of physics) turned into stroies appeal to me. Loosely exploring science this way is entertaining and inspiring and I think Tenet is the best example of this yet. This does perhaps mean that it suffers over doing a psuedo scientific running explanation that goes a step beyond pushing a pencil through folded paper, but it isn't much further; a natural step if you will. 

As ever, Nolan's choice of timeline is excellent, although perhaps warrrents a second watch to fully appreciate, particularly as things ramp up. I'm very keen to watch it once again to work out some of the details of the final combat scene, to really check the attention to detail and how the network of players interact.
As I watched I followed by considering a model outlined in the following diagram:


I'd really like to take some time in the future to plot the film out that way, better than my already fading memory serves me now.

I guess overall Tenet had everything I love about film, and for me, the boldness makes some of the weaker points excusable (concessions always have to be made somewhere in films). I think a film that challegnes conventions as much as this simply leaves itself open for people to pick on tropes that usually wouldn't garner a second look.
