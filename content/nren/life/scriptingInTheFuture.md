# On the future of programming

My work for my PhD has been a very eye opening one so far. For context, I am exploring the use of 'modern' programming techniques for the design and creation of Digital Musical Instruments. 

That may look like anything from this:

Most specifically though, I am looking at how we can build abstractions, use functional programming and strong types to make it an easier but also unrestricted process for the creation of ones own digital instrument.

While my research won't necessarily fully realise that, it really has me thinking about how useful that is for ...basically every domain. With a good level of mathematical literacy (and I think a programmable future is a good motivator for that - more on that later) the power to get devices to cater exactly to your own flow is probably the holy grail of user interfacing.
