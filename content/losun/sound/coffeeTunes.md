# Coffee Tunes

A collection of ident-like musical pieces themed around making coffee. One interesting aspect of this project was created using a max/MSP patch that synthesises a boiling, whistling kettle. I may look to dig out this patch sometime as it was quite an interesting model. This is a project I really liked the character of and so have kept it around, though I'd really like to go back to this and improve it some day.
