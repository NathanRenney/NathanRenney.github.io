# Some short audio cues

This is a collection of short cinematic cues written for a reasonably traditional instrumentation.
These pieces were put together to explore some sample libraries and experiment with a traditional sound palette. Some of these pieces have got a place in a future project I think. 


# At Hand

A building, swarming, crescendo of strings that swells up to a peak aiming to portray a grand vastness, punctuated by brass.

> Of course this is produced using exclusively sampled instruments and the ostinato could definitely use tightening up rhymically.

# Let Loose

Another crescendo, but not so tense. Aiming to give the sense of traversing space.

# Homestead Rise

The title sums this one up to me.

# Open Side Waltz

A quaint little piece based around a progressive pizzicato pattern, adding layers as it grows.

# Fifth Theme

This piece is a little bit of an outlier in this collection - based around a 5/8 pattern with an irregular feeling.
